# OpenCV

**1. Getting Started with Images**

This notebook will help you take your first steps in learning Image Processing and Computer Vision using OpenCV. You will learn some important lessons using some simple examples. In this notebook, you will learn the following:

* Reading an image
* Check image attributes like datatype and shape
* Matrix representation of an image in Numpy
* Color Images and splitting/merging image channels
* Displaying images using matplotlib
* Saving images

**2. Basic Image Manipulations**

In this notebook we will cover how to perform image transformations including:

* Accessing and manipulating images pixels
* Image resizing
* Cropping
* Flipping


**3. Annotating Images**

In this notebook we will cover how to annotate images using OpenCV. We will learn how to peform the following annotations to images.

* Draw lines
* Draw circles
* Draw rectangles
* Add text


**4. Image enhancement**

Image Processing techniques take advantage of mathematical operations to achieve different results. Most often we arrive at an enhanced version of the image using some basic operations. We will take a look at some of the fundamental operations often used in computer vision pipelines. In this notebook we will cover:

* Arithmetic Operations like addition, multiplication
* Thresholding & Masking
* Bitwise Operations like OR, AND, XOR
